# Raspberry Pi Setup Guide

A really opionionated guide how to setup every version of a Raspberry Pi with Arch Linux including NTP, Wi-Fi, SSH,
asdf, Ruby, ZSH and more.

Take a look into the wiki for more interesing stuff like finding out your Raspberry Pi version.


## Some words regarding the hardware

I recommend you to get a speed class 10 SD Card with more than 16 GB capacity for optimal performance.

Additionally you should buy a small heatsink. [Something like that](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=raspberry%20pi%20heatsink&sprefix=raspberry+pi+he%2Caps&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Araspberry%20pi%20heatsink) and attach it to the CPU of the Raspberry Pi.


## What you'll need

- A linux or mac machine with a working SD card slot
- Linux: `tar`, `fdisk`
- MacOS: `e2fsprogs`, `gptfdisk`, `osxfuse`, `ext2fuse` brew packages


## 1. Setup the SD card
### 1.1. Format the SD card

Replace `/dev/devX` with the SD Card device. Make sure that the device is the SD card and not your harddrive, otherwise
you'll destroy your linux installation! You can see which device you'll have to use by running `sudo fdisk -l` after putting the SD card into the slot.


#### 1.1.1 Linux

1. Start `fdisk` via `sudo fdisk /dev/devX`.
2. At the fdisk prompt, delete existing partitions: Type `o`. This will clear out any partitions on the drive. Then type
   `p` to list partitions. There should be no partitions left.
3. Type `n`, then `p` for primary, `1` for the first partition on the drive, press `ENTER` to accept the default first sector, then type `+100M` for the last sector.
4. Type `t`, then `c` to set the first partition to type `W95 FAT32 (LBA)`.
5. Type `n` again (and `p` for primary when asked for the type), `2` for the second partition on the drive, and then press `ENTER` twice to accept the default first and last sector.
6. Write the partition table and exit by typing `w`.
7. Now create a FAT filesystem: `mkfs.vfat /dev/devX1` and mount the new boot partition via
   `mkdir boot && sudo mount /dev/devX1 boot`
8. Also create the ext4 filesystem for the root partition: `mkfs.ext4 /dev/devX2` and mount it:
   `mkdir root && sudo mount /dev/devX2 root`

#### 1.1.2 MacOS

This solution doesnt work yet without downloading [Paragon](https://www.paragon-software.com/home/extfs-mac), sorry.

1. Run `diskutil list` and find your SD card - It will be listed as (external, physical) and show your SD card's size.
2. Start `gdisk` via `sudo gdisk /dev/diskX`(Replace X with your SD card location.)
3. At the gdisk prompt, delete existing partitions: Type `o`. This will clear out any partitions on the drive. Then type `p` to list partitions. There should be no partitions left.
3. Type `n`, then `1` for the first partition on the drive, press `ENTER` to accept the default first sector, then type `+100M` for the last sector.
4. Enter `0700` for partition type. Output should read 'Changed type of partition to 'Microsoft basic data'
5. Type `n` again and `2` for the second partition on the drive, and then press `ENTER` twice to accept the default first and last sector. This time the partition type code is `8300`. Output should read 'Changed type of partition to 'Linux filesystem''
6. Write the partition table and exit by typing `w`.
7. Create a directory to boot from `mkdir boot`
8. Unmount disk `diskutil unmountDisk diskX` (to avoid "Resource busy" error)
9. Now create a FAT filesystem: `sudo newfs_exfat /dev/diskXs1` and mount the new boot partition via
   `sudo mount -t exfat /dev/diskXs1 boot`
8. Install e2fsprogs (unless installed) `brew install e2fsprogs` and create the ext4 filesystem for the root partition: `sudo /usr/local/opt/e2fsprogs/sbin/mkfs.ext2 /dev/diskXs2` and mount it via Paragon extFS for Mac.




### 1.2. Download the image from the website

You may find the downloads on
[www.archlinuxarm.org](http://www.archlinuxarm.org) for the latest version of Arch Linux for Raspberry Pi.


```bash
wget http://archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-4-latest.tar.gz
sudo tar -xpf ArchLinuxARM-rpi-4-latest.tar.gz -C boot
sync
```


### 1.3. Write the files onto the SD Card

```bash
sudo mv root/boot/* boot/
sudo umount boot root
```


### 1.4. Put the SD Card into your pi, power it on and login with `alarm`/`alarm`

You can have connected a keyboard via USB and some kind of screen via HDMI or you can connect to the Pi via SSH after
it's booted.


## 2. Basic system setup

First of all get root:

```bash
su
```

The password is `root`.


### 2.1. German keyboard layout

Of course just if you want to have a german keyboard layout. You may skip this step or use another layout.

```bash
loadkeys de
echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
echo KEYMAP=de-latin1-nodeadkeys > /etc/vconsole.conf
sed -i "s/#en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/" /etc/locale.gen
locale-gen
```

Logout and back in for the settings to take effect.


### 2.2. Setup swapfile

```bash
fallocate -l 1024M /swapfile
chmod 600 /swapfile
mkswap /swapfile
swapon /swapfile
echo 'vm.swappiness=1' > /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf
```

* Then add the following line to `/etc/fstab`:

```bash
/swapfile none swap defaults 0 0
```


### 2.3. Set hardware clock to UTC and set timezone

```bash
timedatectl set-local-rtc 0

ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Berlin /etc/localtime
```

* Set to "Europe/Berlin"


## 3. Update system and enable NTP
### 3.1. Tweak pacman

```bash
sed -i 's/#Color/Color/' /etc/pacman.conf # Add color to pacman
```


### 3.2. System update

```bash
pacman-key --init
pacman-key --populate archlinuxarm
pacman -Syu
reboot
```

After the Pi is booted again, connect via SSH (if you don't have attached a keyboard and screen) and login with `alarm`/`alarm` and get root again via `su`.


### 3.3. NTP

```bash
pacman -S ntp fake-hwclock
systemctl enable ntpd.service
systemctl start ntpd.service
```


## 4. Advanced setup
### 4.1. Set a secure root passwd

```bash
passwd
```


### 4.2. Set hostname

```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname your-hostname
```


### 4.3. sudo & user

```bash
pacman -S sudo vim
visudo
```

* Search for following line and uncomment it:

```bash
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

* Add a new user (replace `yourUserName` with your username!)

```bash
useradd -d /home/yourUserName -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash yourUserName
```

* Set a password for your new user:

```bash
passwd yourUserName
```

* Log out and log in with our newly created user

* After that, delete the old `alarm` user:

```bash
sudo userdel alarm
```


### 4.4. Additional software

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed nfs-utils htop openssh autofs alsa-utils alsa-firmware alsa-lib alsa-plugins git zsh wget base-devel diffutils libnewt dialog wpa_supplicant wireless_tools iw crda lshw
```


* Install yaourt:

```bash
wget https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/package-query.tar.gz
tar -xvzf package-query.tar.gz
cd package-query
makepkg -si
cd ..
wget https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/yaourt.tar.gz
tar -xvzf yaourt.tar.gz
cd yaourt
makepkg -si

cd ../
rm -rf package-query/ package-query.tar.gz yaourt/ yaourt.tar.gz
```


### 4.5 vcgencmd and other vc tools

These tools are RPi specific and help you to work with the hardware like settings some options or reading system stats.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/profile
```

Change the line saying `PATH=`:

```bash
# Set our default path
PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/opt/vc/sbin:/opt/vc/bin"
export PATH
```

And reload it:

```bash
source /etc/profile
```

* The last both command should give an `ok` or something similar. If not, something may be broken.



## 5. Sound

This is just for Raspberry Pi 1.

Set the output device

```bash
sudo amixer cset numid=3 1
```



## 6. Raspberry Pi overclocking

You may want to overclock the Pi. And you won't even lose the guarantee for your pi, if you use the "offical"
overclocking presets. The simplest way to overclock the pi is `rasp-config` tool which ships with the offical allowed
overclocking presets.

```
wget https://raw.github.com/chattama/raspi-config-archlinux/archlinux/raspi-config
```

Get to the overclocking menu and choose the overclocking preset you want. I recommend the "high" preset. After changing
the overclocking preset, reboot your raspberry pi.



## 7. Wi-Fi

```bash
sudo wifi-menu -o
netctl start yourWifiSSID
netctl enable yourWifiSSID
```

## 8. ASDF

asdf is awesome version manager for interpreted programming languages like nodejs, ruby, crystal and so on.

```bash
yaourt -S asdf-vm
```


## 9. Ruby

```bash
asdf install ruby 2.6.4 # or whatever you need
```


## 10. ZSH and dotfiles

If you want to use ZSH
```bash
sudo usermod -s /usr/bin/zsh
```

Additionally you may want to clone and setup your personal dotfiles.

* Logout and login back again or just reboot the pi


## 11. Tweaks
### 11.1 Increase SD card lifetime

Change in your fstab:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/fstab
```

```
/dev/root  /  ext4  defaults,nodiratime,noatime,discard  0  0
```
